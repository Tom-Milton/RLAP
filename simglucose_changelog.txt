    25                          Check if self.prev_state is -1 to force set the previous state to the current blood glucose at the start of simulation
    40                          Don't split action into basal and bolus for consistency
    45                          Changed self.prev_state from 0 to -1 so that the first blood glucose reading isn't incorrectly given as 0
